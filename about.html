            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>I came to study Homeopathic Medicine later in life after the loss of my husband of 32 years.  He and I shared a small business together, where I looked after all office work.  Since I had an educational background in Administrative Assistant this job was very easy for me.  Never challenged enough by this, I had a successful career in sales at Dufresne Furniture in Winnipeg.  It was when I was moved into the bedding department selling only beds that I discovered just how many people are looking for an alternative to our medical system.  I also discovered just how many sleep issues people have, and quickly realized people are not sleeping because their bed isn't right, but because<b> they cannot shut off the voice in their head.</b></p>
            <p>Through the grieving process I studied Eckhart Tolle's teachings daily, and was able to find sleep and peace.  After my husband's illness and passing I found myself getting physically sick with pneumonias that were not responding to antibiotics.  It was at this time that I started treatment with a Homeopath.  Experiencing better health, and a sense of overall well being after treatment.  The physical illnesses was a direct result of the suppression of grief, and when given a medicine that targeted the grief state I was able to release so much of the grief with more tears then I would have ever allowed myself to shed previously. The idea that crying was a sign of weakness had been strongly embedded since childhood.  Since being treated Homeopathically I have transformed back to a state of physical and mental health like when I was a child. </p>

            <p>After experiencing these changes for myself I wanted to learn everything I could to be able to bring this to other people.  I went through an in depth personality study with a career councillor to be sure I was heading in the right direction.  Being perfectly suited I looked for schools and found that the Canadian College of Homeopathic Medicine(CCHM) was the longest operating College in Canada, and they teach Classical Homeopathy. They provide both internship and externship to give students hands on learning.</p>
            
            <p>I took the plunge and moved to Toronto for three years to secure the best education in the medical art of homeopathic medicine.  It was a very good way for me to leave my past behind and start anew.  I did not know a person in Toronto, so it really was like a brand new life. I believe I would have never been able to do this if I had not dealt with my loss in a healthy way without any anti-depressants or sleep aids, which would have just meant more suppression of real feelings.</p>

            <p>I have always appreciated the individuality of every single person that I meet, and here is a medicine that perfectly emulates this sense.  No two people are the same and should never be treated as such.</p>

            <p>I graduated from CCHM in June 2018, and will continue to study Classical Homeopathy in some post graduate programs.  The first will be starting in May of 2018 with Indian born Homeopath Farokh Master.</p>

                <h2>Norine Gibson</h2>
                
                <p>The activities I enjoy most in life are: hiking, canoeing, camping, walking and the overall peace and tranquility that can always be found out in nature. People are often surprised to find out how great I am at bowling ;)  I adore music, somehow it always seems to fit whatever I'm doing.  I love the Winnipeg Jets and look so forward to living in Winnipeg again, the energy of the Winnipeg crowd is like no other.</p>

                <p>Family has always been very important to me. I have had the pleasure of raising 3 children and all the life lessons that come along with family life.  Now I enjoy 5 beautiful granddaughters ranging in age from 18 months to 10 years old. Although I enjoy spending time with family, I feel that my true calling at this stage of my life is helping others to attain a better state of health. <b>Watching a patient transform into their healthy self is the most rewarding experience for me.</b></p>
